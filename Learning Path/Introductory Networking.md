# TryHackMe Learning Path: Introductory Networking

The aim of this room is to provide a beginner's introduction to the basic principles of networking. Networking is a massive topic, so this really will just be a brief overview; however, it will hopefully give you some foundational knowledge of the topic, which you can build upon for yourself.


## Task 1: Introduction:
Read and Accept

## Task 2: The OSI Model: An Overview:

### 1. Which layer would choose to send data over TCP or UDP?
> 4

### 2. Which layer checks received information to make sure that it hasn't been corrupted?
> 2

### 3. In which layer would data be formatted in preparation for transmission?
> 2

### 4. Which layer transmits and receives data?
> 1

### 5. Which layer encrypts, compresses, or otherwise transforms the initial data to give it a standardised format?
> 6

### 6. Which layer tracks communications between the host and receiving computers?
> 5

### 7. Which layer accepts communication requests from applications?
> 7

### 8. Which layer handles logical addressing?
> 3

### 9. When sending data over TCP, what would you call the "bite-sized" pieces of data?
> Segments

### 10. [Research] Which layer would the FTP protocol communicate with?
> 7

### 11. Which transport layer protocol would be best suited to transmit a live video?
> UDP


## Task 3: Encapsulation:

### 1. How would you refer to data at layer 2 of the encapsulation process (with the OSI model)?
> Frames

### 2. How would you refer to data at layer 4 of the encapsulation process (with the OSI model), if the UDP protocol has been selected?
> Datagrams

### 3. What process would a computer perform on a received message?
> De-encapsulation

### 4. Which is the only layer of the OSI model to add a trailer during encapsulation?
> Data Link

### 5. Does encapsulation provide an extra layer of security (Aye/Nay)?
> Aye


## Task 4: The TCP/IP Model:

Task 5: Privilege Escalation
In this task, you'll learn about how to escalate privileges on web application servers to gain access to sensitive data.

Task 6: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
In this task, you'll learn about cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, how to identify them, and how to exploit them.

Task 7: SQL Injection
In this task, you'll learn about SQL injection vulnerabilities, how to identify them, and how to exploit them.

Task 8: File Inclusion Vulnerabilities
In this task, you'll learn about file inclusion vulnerabilities, how to identify them, and how to exploit them.

Task 9: Secure Coding Practices
In this task, you'll learn about secure coding practices for web applications, including input validation, output encoding, and other best practices.

### TryHackMe Learning Path: Web Application Penetration Testing
This learning path covers the fundamentals of web application penetration testing. Each task builds upon the previous one, so it's recommended to complete them in order.

Task 1: Introduction to Web Application Security
In this task, you'll learn about the basics of web application security, including the OWASP Top Ten vulnerabilities and common attack vectors.

Task 2: Reconnaissance
In this task, you'll learn about reconnaissance techniques such as information gathering and mapping of web applications.

Task 3: Vulnerability Scanning
In this task, you'll learn about vulnerability scanning tools such as Nmap, Nessus, and OpenVAS, and how to use them to find vulnerabilities in web applications.

Task 4: Exploitation
In this task, you'll learn about how to exploit vulnerabilities in web applications using tools such as Metasploit and SQLMap.

Task 5: Privilege Escalation
In this task, you'll learn about how to escalate privileges on web application servers to gain access to sensitive data.

Task 6: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
In this task, you'll learn about cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, how to identify them, and how to exploit them.

Task 7: SQL Injection
In this task, you'll learn about SQL injection vulnerabilities, how to identify them, and how to exploit them.

Task 8: File Inclusion Vulnerabilities
In this task, you'll learn about file inclusion vulnerabilities, how to identify them, and how to exploit them.

Task 9: Secure Coding Practices
In this task, you'll learn about secure coding practices for web applications, including input validation, output encoding, and other best practices.
